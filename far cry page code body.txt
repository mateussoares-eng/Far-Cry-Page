        Far Cry is a 2004 first-person shooter game developed by Crytek and
        published by Ubisoft. It is the first installment in the Far Cry
        franchise. Set on a mysterious tropical archipelago, the game follows Jack
        Carver, a former American special operations forces operative, as he
        searches for journalist Valerie Constantine, who accompanied him to the
        islands but went missing after their boat was destroyed by mercenaries. As
        Jack explores the islands, he begins to discover the horrific genetic
        experiments being conducted on the local wildlife and must confront the
        mad scientist behind them. The game was the first to use Crytek's
        CryEngine, and was designed as an open-ended first-person shooter, though
        it lacks most of the freedom its successors would offer to the player.
        While players can freely explore the game's world like in later Far Cry
        titles, they are most often discouraged from doing so due to the linear
        structure of missions and the lack of side content. Despite this, the
        gameplay formula established in Far Cry—placing the player in a foreign
        environment occupied by enemy forces where they must use various weapons
        and tools, as well as their surroundings to overcome any threat—would
        prove essential in defining the series' identity going forward. Far Cry
        was released for Microsoft Windows in March 2004 to generally positive
        reviews, being praised for its visuals, gameplay mechanics, and the level
        of freedom given to players. The game was also a commercial success,
        selling over 730,000 units within four months of release and over 2.5
        million units in its lifetime. The success of Far Cry led to a series of
        standalone sequels developed by Ubisoft, starting with Far Cry 2 in 2008.
        A remake of the game with a different storyline and new mechanics, Far Cry
        Instincts, was released for the Xbox in 2005, and for the Xbox 360 in 2006
        as part of the Far Cry Instincts: Predator compilation. A loose film
        adaptation was released in 2008. The original version of Far Cry, updated
        with HD graphics, was re-released under the title Far Cry Classic for the
        PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2014. Gameplay Far Cry is a standard
        first-person shooter set in an open-ended environment: an unidentified
        archipelago in the South Pacific. The tropical rain forest provides cover
        and concealment, of which both the player and enemies can take advantage.
        Enemies react dynamically to the player's tactics and actions. If a lone
        mercenary spots a player, he occasionally runs for help, signaling
        reinforcements through use of flareguns. Enemies will work together to
        outmaneuver, outflank, surround, and provide suppressive fire, providing
        them a tactical advantage over the player, who, in turn, is able to spot
        and mark enemies on their minimap through use of special binoculars, which
        also grant the player the ability to listen to enemy conversations from
        afar, merely by pointing the binoculars in the direction of the enemies.
        Later in the gameplay, thermo binoculars can be used to locate the heat
        signatures of enemies, that would be otherwise concealed by foliage or
        darkness. The environment includes land, water, indoor and outdoor
        structures, all during various times of the day. The player has the
        ability to jump, run, crouch and lie down, and look about in all
        directions. Sound plays an important part in the overall gameplay. For
        example, the general location of enemies can often be identified by
        hearing their footsteps or conversations. Throughout the game, the player
        encounters a variety of weapons from which to choose, including automatic
        weapons and grenades. The open maps allow the player to complete their
        objectives in several different manners. When outdoors, the player is
        usually presented with a fairly simple set of possible routes to their
        objective, but these do not necessarily have to be used. Outdoor map level
        designs are constructed in a way that allows the player to try different
        angles for assaults, or even completely circumvent enemies (given enough
        time to maneuver). However, during the indoor sections of the game, level
        design tends to lose this attribute in favor of a more traditional, linear
        gameplay.

      Far Cry 2 is a 2008 first-person shooter developed by Ubisoft Montreal and
      published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A
      top-down shooter version for mobile phones was developed and published by
      Gameloft. It is the second mainline entry in the Far Cry series. Set in a
      fictional African country engulfed in civil war, the storyline follows a
      mercenary who is assigned to kill the Jackal, a weapons dealer inflaming
      the conflict. The player navigates the open world, completing missions for
      factions and allies called Buddies while managing their health and
      equipment. A competitive multiplayer mode allows players to fight in teams
      or as individuals. Production took three and a half years, with concept
      work beginning during the production of Far Cry Instincts (2005). Director
      Clint Hocking conceived the setting and design, which he wanted to be more
      realistic than the original Far Cry (2004). The narrative and tone,
      inspired by Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness and Dashiell
      Hammett's novel Red Harvest, focused on the lengths to which people would
      go to survive through terrible circumstances. The game was built using
      Dunia, a game engine created by Ubisoft based on the original game's
      CryEngine. In pursuit of realism, the developers added real-time and
      reactive elements for enemies and the environment. The music, composed by
      Marc Canham, includes vocals by Senegalese singer Baaba Maal. Far Cry 2
      received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its setting,
      open-ended gameplay, Buddies, world design and visuals; however, its
      writing, artificial intelligence and technical issues received negative
      attention. It received multiple game award nominations. By January 2009,
      the game had sold nearly three million copies worldwide. Far Cry 2 has
      continued to receive attention for its ambition and survival mechanics.
      The team used feedback from the game to develop Far Cry 3 (2012).

      Far Cry 3 is a 2012 first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft
      Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the third main installment in the
      Far Cry series after Far Cry 2. The game takes place on the fictional Rook
      Islands, a tropical archipelago which can be freely explored by players.
      Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration. Players can use a variety of
      weapons to defeat human enemies and hostile wildlife, and the game
      features elements found in role-playing games such as skill trees and
      experience. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save
      his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates, and escape from the
      island and its unhinged inhabitants. Ubisoft Montreal collaborated with
      Ubisoft's global development team, including Massive Entertainment,
      Ubisoft Shanghai, Ubisoft Bucharest, Ubisoft Reflections and Red Storm
      Entertainment. The game's development was partially restarted in 2010
      after the departure of several key creative staff. The team evaluated the
      feedback for Far Cry 2 and identified areas that needed to be improved or
      removed. The team spent considerable time designing the island, which they
      described as the "second most important character" in the game.
      Inspirations were taken from films and TV shows such as Apocalypse Now and
      Lost, as well as video games The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Red Dead
      Redemption. Michael Mando was hired to portray Vaas Montenegro, an
      antagonist the team compared to Darth Vader. The game was announced in
      June 2011 and Ubisoft promoted the game with various companion apps,
      webseries and crossover. It was released for Microsoft Windows,
      PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2012. The game received critical
      acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its characters (particularly
      Vaas), world design, visuals, progression, and gameplay, though the game's
      multiplayer modes received criticism. Despite weak pre-order sales, the
      game was a commercial success, selling 10 million copies. It was nominated
      for multiple year-end accolades including Game of the Year and Best
      Shooter awards by several gaming publications. It has also been cited as
      one of the greatest video games ever made. Ubisoft supported the game with
      downloadable content and released Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the game's
      standalone expansion, in 2013. A successor, Far Cry 4 was released in
      November 2014. The game was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in
      June 2018.

      Far Cry 4 is a 2014 first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft
      Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the successor to the 2012 video
      game Far Cry 3, and the fourth main installment in the Far Cry series. Set
      in the fictional Himalayan country of Kyrat, the game follows Ajay Ghale,
      a young Kyrati-American, who becomes caught in a civil war between Kyrat's
      Royal Army, controlled by the tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel
      movement called the Golden Path. The gameplay focuses on combat and open
      world exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife
      using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in
      role-playing games, such as a branching storyline and side quests. The
      game also features a map editor and both cooperative and competitive
      multiplayer modes. Announced in May 2014, development on Far Cry 4 began
      immediately after the shipment of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The
      team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to Far Cry 3 that
      continues the narrative, but the idea was later scrapped and the team
      decided to develop a new setting and story for the game. Certain aspects
      of Far Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the design of
      the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the
      Killer and Brother. Troy Baker was hired to portray Pagan Min. The game's
      competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the
      Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto. Far
      Cry 4 was released worldwide for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows,
      Xbox 360, and Xbox One in November 2014. It received mostly positive
      reviews, with critics praising the open-world design, visuals, soundtrack,
      and characters as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of
      content. However, some reviewers disliked the story and found the game too
      similar to its predecessor. The game sold over 10 million units by March
      2020. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently
      published. A spin-off title, Far Cry Primal, was released in February
      2016. A successor, Far Cry 5, was released in March 2018.

      Far Cry 5 is a 2018 first-person shooter, developed by Ubisoft Montreal
      and Ubisoft Toronto and published by Ubisoft. It is the successor to
      2014's Far Cry 4, and the fifth main installment in the Far Cry series.
      Set in Hope County, a fictional region of Montana, United States, the game
      revolves around the Project at Eden's Gate, a doomsday cult that has taken
      over the county at the command of its charismatic and powerful leader,
      Joseph Seed. Players control an unnamed junior deputy sheriff who becomes
      trapped in Hope County and must work alongside various resistance factions
      to liberate the region from the despotic rule of the Seeds and Eden's
      Gate. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy
      soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game
      features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a branching
      storyline and side quests. The game also features a map editor, a
      co-operative multiplayer mode, and a competitive multiplayer mode.
      Announced in early 2017, development on Far Cry 5 was extensive. The team
      explored several concepts before settling on an American location. The
      game was heavily inspired by several socio-political events in modern
      history, such as the Cold War and the September 11 attacks. The
      development team sought to capture the despondent social climate after the
      events and re-purpose it for the game. Developed and published solely by
      Ubisoft, its competitive multiplayer mode was also created in-house, with
      the company's worldwide studios gaining more creative input for Far Cry 5.
      Far Cry 5 was released worldwide for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One
      in March 2018. It received mostly positive reviews, although it was the
      subject of controversy after being announced alongside a period of
      heightened political conflicts. Critics praised the open world design,
      visuals, gameplay and soundtrack but directed criticisms towards its story
      and some of the characters. The game was a commercial success, becoming
      the fastest-selling title in the franchise by grossing over $310 million
      in its first week of sales and had sold over 10 million units by March
      2020. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently
      published. A spin-off title and sequel to the narrative, Far Cry New Dawn,
      was released in February 2019. A successor, Far Cry 6, was released in
      October 2021.

      Far Cry 6 is a 2021 first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft Toronto
      and published by Ubisoft. It is the sixth main installment in the Far Cry
      series and the successor to 2018's Far Cry 5. The game is set on the
      fictional Caribbean island of Yara, ruled as a dictatorship by "El
      Presidente" Antón Castillo (portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito) who is
      raising his son Diego (Anthony Gonzalez) to follow in his rule. Players
      take on the role of guerilla fighter Dani Rojas (voiced by either Nisa
      Gunduz or Sean Rey), attempting to topple Castillo and his regime.
      Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players fight enemy soldiers
      and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons and gadgets. The game
      features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a leveling-up
      system and side quests. It also features a cooperative multiplayer mode.
      Development of Far Cry 6 began around 2016 and was extensive. The team
      studied several revolutions of recent history for the game's narrative,
      primarily the Cuban Revolution of 1953–1959. The game was designed to be
      'political', covering themes such as the rise of fascism in a nation, the
      costs of imperialism, and the need for free-and-fair elections, in
      response to the controversy generated by Far Cry 5. The development team
      also sought to bring back several elements from earlier Far Cry titles
      such as a tropical setting and a fully-voiced protagonist. The game was
      first teased by Esposito in July 2020, and officially announced later that
      month, at the Ubisoft Forward online event. Far Cry 6 was released
      worldwide for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Windows, Xbox One and
      Xbox Series X/S on October 7, 2021. It received mixed reviews from
      critics, who praised the small improvements brought to the series'
      gameplay formula, but criticized its story and lack of innovation. Several
      releases of downloadable content were subsequently published, including
      three expansion packs centered around antagonists from past Far Cry games.
