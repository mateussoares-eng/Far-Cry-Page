        It is the successor to
      2014's Far Cry 4, and the fifth main installment in the Far Cry series.
      Set in Hope County, a fictional region of Montana, United States, the game
      revolves around the Project at Eden's Gate, a doomsday cult that has taken
      over the county at the command of its charismatic and powerful leader,
      Joseph Seed. Players control an unnamed junior deputy sheriff who becomes
      trapped in Hope County and must work alongside various resistance factions
      to liberate the region from the despotic rule of the Seeds and Eden's
      Gate. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy
      soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game
      features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a branching
      storyline and side quests. The game also features a map editor, a
      co-operative multiplayer mode, and a competitive multiplayer mode.
      Announced in early 2017, development on Far Cry 5 was extensive. The team
      explored several concepts before settling on an American location. The
      game was heavily inspired by several socio-political events in modern
      history, such as the Cold War and the September 11 attacks. <br><br><img src="images/ss_8f826d6b68fc53c48f1f52f9d5188ba998b23534.1920x1080.jpg" alt=""> <br><br> The
      development team sought to capture the despondent social climate after the
      events and re-purpose it for the game. Developed and published solely by
      Ubisoft, its competitive multiplayer mode was also created in-house, with
      the company's worldwide studios gaining more creative input for Far Cry 5.
      Far Cry 5 was released worldwide for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One
      in March 2018. It received mostly positive reviews, although it was the
      subject of controversy after being announced alongside a period of
      heightened political conflicts.  <br><br><img src="images/ss_e77cdee777bf7cc1fc820e6e3442c23166dfbc4b.1920x1080.jpg" alt=""> <br><br>Critics praised the open world design,
      visuals, gameplay and soundtrack but directed criticisms towards its story
      and some of the characters. The game was a commercial success, becoming
      the fastest-selling title in the franchise by grossing over $310 million
      in its first week of sales and had sold over 10 million units by March
      2020. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently
      published. A spin-off title and sequel to the narrative, Far Cry New Dawn,
      was released in February 2019. A successor, Far Cry 6, was released in
      October 2021.
