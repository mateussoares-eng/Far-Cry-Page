        It is the third main installment in the
      Far Cry series after Far Cry 2. The game takes place on the fictional Rook
      Islands, a tropical archipelago which can be freely explored by players.
      Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration. Players can use a variety of
      weapons to defeat human enemies and hostile wildlife, and the game
      features elements found in role-playing games such as skill trees and
      experience. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save
      his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates, and escape from the
      island and its unhinged inhabitants. Ubisoft Montreal collaborated with
      Ubisoft's global development team, including Massive Entertainment,
      Ubisoft Shanghai, Ubisoft Bucharest, Ubisoft Reflections and Red Storm
      Entertainment. <br><br> <img src="images/ss_b318ad7c388f9a2d2d9afa1c35789e130f46333e.1920x1080.jpg" alt=""> <br><br> The game's development was partially restarted in 2010
      after the departure of several key creative staff. The team evaluated the
      feedback for Far Cry 2 and identified areas that needed to be improved or
      removed. The team spent considerable time designing the island, which they
      described as the "second most important character" in the game.
      Inspirations were taken from films and TV shows such as Apocalypse Now and
      Lost, as well as video games The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Red Dead
      Redemption. Michael Mando was hired to portray Vaas Montenegro, an
      antagonist the team compared to Darth Vader. The game was announced in
      June 2011 and Ubisoft promoted the game with various companion apps,
      webseries and crossover. It was released for Microsoft Windows,
      PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2012. <br><br><img src="images/911FB+iLkEL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt=""> <br><br> The game received critical
      acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its characters (particularly
      Vaas), world design, visuals, progression, and gameplay, though the game's
      multiplayer modes received criticism. Despite weak pre-order sales, the
      game was a commercial success, selling 10 million copies. It was nominated
      for multiple year-end accolades including Game of the Year and Best
      Shooter awards by several gaming publications. It has also been cited as
      one of the greatest video games ever made. Ubisoft supported the game with
      downloadable content and released Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the game's
      standalone expansion, in 2013. A successor, Far Cry 4 was released in
      November 2014. The game was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in
      June 2018.
