        It is the sixth main installment in the Far Cry
      series and the successor to 2018's Far Cry 5. The game is set on the
      fictional Caribbean island of Yara, ruled as a dictatorship by "El
      Presidente" Antón Castillo (portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito) who is
      raising his son Diego (Anthony Gonzalez) to follow in his rule. Players
      take on the role of guerilla fighter Dani Rojas (voiced by either Nisa
      Gunduz or Sean Rey), attempting to topple Castillo and his regime.
      Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players fight enemy soldiers
      and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons and gadgets. <br><br><img src="images/pagan-control.jpg" alt=""> <br><br> The game
      features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a leveling-up
      system and side quests. It also features a cooperative multiplayer mode.
      Development of Far Cry 6 began around 2016 and was extensive. The team
      studied several revolutions of recent history for the game's narrative,
      primarily the Cuban Revolution of 1953–1959. The game was designed to be
      'political', covering themes such as the rise of fascism in a nation, the
      costs of imperialism, and the need for free-and-fair elections, in
      response to the controversy generated by Far Cry 5. <br><br><img src="images/far-cry-6-einhorn-guide-zebra_6156357.jpg" alt=""> The development team
      also sought to bring back several elements from earlier Far Cry titles
      such as a tropical setting and a fully-voiced protagonist. The game was
      first teased by Esposito in July 2020, and officially announced later that
      month, at the Ubisoft Forward online event. Far Cry 6 was released
      worldwide for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Windows, Xbox One and
      Xbox Series X/S on October 7, 2021. It received mixed reviews from
      critics, who praised the small improvements brought to the series'
      gameplay formula, but criticized its story and lack of innovation. Several
      releases of downloadable content were subsequently published, including
      three expansion packs centered around antagonists from past Far Cry games.
